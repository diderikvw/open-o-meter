The open-O-meter is a simple scale from 0 to 10 where a product gets one point for each of the following aspects:

- ARE DESIGN FILES PUBLISHED?
- ARE ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS PUBLISHED?
- IS THE BILL OF MATERIALS PUBLISHED?
- IS THE CONTRIBUTING GUIDE PUBLISHED?
- ARE THE PUBLISHED DESIGN FILES IN EDITABLE FORMATS?
- IS THE PUBLISHED ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS EDITABLE?
- IS THE PUBLISHED BILL OF MATERIALS EDITABLE?
- DO THEY ALLOW PARTIAL OR FULL REDISTRIBUTION FOR NON-COMMERCIALS PURPOSES?
- DO THEY ALLOW FREE REDISTRIBUTION OF SOME ELEMENTS, ALSO FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES?
- DO THEY ALLOW FREE REDISTRIBUTION OF THE FULL PRODUCT, ALSO FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES?

It is simple:

- if a product gets 10 points, it conforms to the best practices of open source hardware.
- if a product gets 0 points, it does not seem to be open at all and should not be labeled as open source.
- if a product gets between 1 and 9, it is on it's way!
