The open-O-meter is a simple scale from 0 to 8 where a product gets one point for each of the following aspects:

- design files are published;
- assembly instructions are published;
- a bill of materials is published;
- a contribution guide is published;
- the published CAD files are in editable format;
- the published assembly instructions are in editable format;
- the published bill of materials is in editable format;
- all this information is published under a license allowing commercial reuse.

It is simple:

- if a product gets 8 points, it conforms to the best practices of open source hardware.
- if a product gets 0 points, it does not seem to be open at all and should not be labeled as open source.
- if a product gets between 1 and 7, it is on it's way!
